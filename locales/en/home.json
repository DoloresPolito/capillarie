More than gender, the important thing is to see if the patient is a good candidate for surgery (good quality donor area, type and extent of alopecia, etc.). Your dermatologist will advise you based on your individual characteristics.","ans2":"Medically, this surgery can be performed any time of the year. Typically, the date is decided based on when the patient can dedicate approximately one week to post-procedure care.","ans3":"Improvement is not usually seen until 6 months. From 6 months, the patient progressively improves until 12 months, when the final result is usually seen. In women, it can even take 18 months to see the final result.","ans4":"Cutting your hair a lot or frequently does not affect the quality of the hair, as this is determined by the activity of the hair follicle, which is located at the root, that is, under the skin of the scalp.","bookbutton":"Book an appoiment","contactaddress":"31-32 Wellington Quay 1st floor, D02KP11, Dublin","contactbutton":"Book an appoiment","contactsectiontitle":"CONTACT","faq1":"Can both men and women have surgery?","faq2":"Is there a better time of year than another to have surgery?","faq3":"When is the final result of the transplant seen?","faq4":"Does frequent hair cutting make it grow stronger?","faqstitle":"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS","financingbutton":"Choose the financing that best suits for you","hairbutton":"Learn more","hairitem1":"Best quality / price ratio","hairitem2":"The surgery includes 6 sessions of Platelet-Rich Plasma (3 pre and 3 post)","hairitem3":"We use the best techniques for your hair","hairitem4":"The results can be seen between 3 and 6 months","hairsectiontitle":"COMPLETE HAIR SURGERY","hairsubtitle":"In Dublin we offer F.U.E hair transplant surgery with as many follicles as needed, including all pre-and port-operative revisions.","resultstitle":"RESULTS","review1":"Thank you very much Pablo.
